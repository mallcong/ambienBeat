ttest3.png summarizes p-values from paired t-tests (Df = 11). 

(a) p-values from the paired t-test of SDNNs. (b) p-values from the paired t-test of average HR (c) p-values from the paired t-test of the slopes of the linear regression of the HR change over time.  The bold text in a yellow cell highlights the condition that rejects the null hypothesis (p-value < 0.05). Only the bold text presents the condition that has a considerable trend toward significance.
